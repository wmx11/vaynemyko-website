I have compiled a list of 100+ Twitter creator profiles and their websites.

You will see how creators, from the smallest to the largest, structure their profile descriptions and what words they use to make them feel magnetic.

Most of these creators have either a personal website, a newsletter, or a service they provide. I go into detail about how these websites are structured. What headings, subheadings, and calls to action do they use to catch the attention of visitors?

You will also find out what tools these creators used to build their newsletters or personal websites.

This resource will be periodically updated with detailed page and description breakdowns.
