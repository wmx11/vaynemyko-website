You have probably heard the terms entrepreneur and solopreneur being used quite a lot on social media or other channels. They have become prevalent with the rise of social media. Especially the likes of Twitter, Instagram, and even Facebook.

These terms refer to people who have a knack for businesses or anything related to businesses.

Entrepreneurs have been around for a while. In fact, most startups and private business owners can be considered entrepreneurs.

Things change when we start talking about solopreneurs.

## What is a solopreneur?

The term "solopreneur" gained popularity with the rise of Justin Welsh. He seems to be the first person to have coined this term, and it has become part of his brand.

A solopreneur is essentially an entrepreneur who works alone. Someone who runs their own business or businesses with the help of automation Usually, these businesses are in the fields of coaching, consulting, and information products. Also, solopreneurs don't have a dedicated team. Sometimes they may hire a virtual assistant to help them with emails and other tasks. Other times, they may hire contractors to tackle some ambitious tasks. But usually, they do most of the work themselves, either with the help of AI, automation, or just sheer willpower.

Solopreneurship allows the person to earn based on their different income streams and how well they can market and sell their products.

**The flexibility is just insane.**  

Be it solopreneurship or one-person business, I just love the fact you can retain the freedom of time, location, and even income.

This brings me to the term "Digital Blacksmith".

A term I love to use when talking about people working in the digital field of business and social media.

## Who are "Digital Blacksmiths"?

Digital blacksmiths are essentially creators for the digital world. While it does not have to be limited to the digital world, they can create digital or local businesses, assets, communities, products, and services. They have the ability to forge anything that comes to mind.

They are entrepreneurs, but they possess the qualities necessary to run a successful one-person business.

## What are these qualities?

A digital blacksmith possesses these qualities:

- Patience
- Integrity
- Creativity
- Perseverance
- Problem-solving
- Customer service
- Life-long learning
- Pride in their craft
- Community and sharing
- Thinking outside the box

I strongly believe these are the qualities necessary to be a successful digital blacksmith and to run a successful one-person business.

I will also add that community and sharing play a huge role in the success of the business and the community. We can call these communities "guilds". A place where knowledge and experience are shared among other peers. A place where apprentices join to become masters of their craft

## What do "Digital Blacksmiths" do?

Digital blacksmiths can take on many roles, but all of them relate to creativity and solving certain problems. They care more about helping other people than solving their own problems.

These artisans can be seen in the fields of copywriting, design, music production, coding, the arts, storytelling, marketing, and other creative fields.

**The main differentiator is that they solve problems for other people. They help them reach their goals. They also educate them on their specific topics.**  

Digital blacksmiths care about their customers and will build strong networks and relationships that will become large communities of value in the future.

And only through these networks and communities can we make a huge impact on people and their lives.

## How do I become a "Digital Blacksmith"?

If you want to become a digital blacksmith, you will want to spend time developing the traits of one. The best way to do it is by joining a community of other creators or a community of digital blacksmiths.

You would be joining as an apprentice, and you will be expected to put in the work and time to learn new skills.

**If you are a creative person, I believe you are closer than ever to being a digital blacksmith.**  

I suggest building things for other people. Make them happy with your work. Forge deep connections with your peers. Be an exemplary person they can look up to.

And since you are reading this note, you are one step closer to becoming one.

And I really appreciate your curiosity and enthusiasm!

All in all, entrepreneurship and solopreneurship are great choices if you want to build your own business and income empire. But I believe that Digital Blacksmiths are the ones shaping the digital fabric through their creativity and integrity. Building tight-knit communities where people can come and learn. A collective knowledge that can help people forge their own path. If you choose to become one, become the best version of yourself. Welcome to the guild.
